        "Using a deque from the collections module to implement a queue offers several advantages over using a regular Python list:\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient Operations: deque is optimized for fast append and pop operations from both ends of the queue. While a list can perform these operations as well, deque typically provides better performance for large queues because it's optimized for these specific operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thread Safety: If our application involves multithreading and we need a thread-safe queue, deque can be a better choice than a list. deque provides atomic operations that can be safely accessed from multiple threads without the need for explicit locking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: deque can be more memory-efficient than a list, especially when dealing with large queues. deque uses a doubly linked list under the hood, which allows it to grow and shrink efficiently without the need to allocate large blocks of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rotating Elements: deque supports efficient rotation of elements, which can be useful in certain scenarios. we can rotate elements to the left or right using the rotate() method, which may be beneficial in specific queue implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clearer Intent: Using a deque explicitly states our intention to implement a queue-like data structure, making our code more readable and maintainable. It communicates the semantics of a queue to other developers more effectively than using a regular list."

        "Backward Navigation: When a user clicks the \"Back\" button, they expect to go back to the previously visited page. Using a stack, we can easily achieve this by popping the top item from the stack, which represents the last page visited. This corresponds perfectly to the behavior of a stack, where the last item pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off.\n",
        "\n",
        "Forward Navigation: Similarly, when a user clicks the \"Forward\" button after navigating backward, they expect to go forward to the page they were previously on. Again, using a stack, we can achieve this by pushing the previously popped item back onto the stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Stacks are more memory-efficient for this scenario because they only need to store the user's immediate browsing history. As the user navigates backward, the forward history is automatically discarded, keeping only the necessary pages in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Intuitive Behavior: Using a stack for managing browser history provides an intuitive behavior that matches users' mental models. Users expect the navigation to work in a \"last in, first out\" manner, which aligns perfectly with the behavior of a stack."
